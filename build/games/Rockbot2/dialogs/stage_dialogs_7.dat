THE STARS ARE ALL ALIGNED,
YOUR FATE IS DECIDED,
DEFEAT IS IN YOUR FUTURE.



FATE? DESTINY? FOR A ROBOT?
SORRY, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT. PROVE ME WRONG.



SORRY MISTER, I DON'T
BELIEVE IN HOROSCOPES.
I WILL SHOW YOU.



THOSE RUINS ARE A 
BAUTIFUL PLACE. DON'T RUIN
IT WITH SUCH NONSENSE.



THEN I HAVE NO CHOISE BUT
TO FIGHT MY DESTINY AND
DEFEAT YOU ANYWAY POSSIBLE.
