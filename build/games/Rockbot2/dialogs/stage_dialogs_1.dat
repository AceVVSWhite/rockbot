YOU ARE ENTERING A MISSILE

TESTING LOCATION. THERE ARE

EXPLOSIVES EVERYWHERE.







OK, PROFESSOR.

I WILL LOOK OUT FOR ANY

MINES AND TANKS.







OH MY!

I WILL JUMP AWAY FROM

THOSE PESKY BOMBS!







I CAN RESISTI A FEW BLASTS.











LET THE FIREWORKS SHINE,

A CAT LIKE ME WON'T BE

TAKEN BY SURPRISE.







YOU ARE SURPASSING MILITARY

TERRITORY. FORCE MEASURES

ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE.
